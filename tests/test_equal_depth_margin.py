"""A colour pass that tests depth EQUAL gets a margin towards the camera on Intel.

The game draws a depth prepass, then colour passes that test EQUAL against it with another program. Intel's compiler
does not give the two programs the same position to the last bit, so most ground pixels failed the test and the sky
showed through (issue 17, Arc B390). The test becomes LESS_OR_EQUAL with a depth bias towards the camera, only where depth
is tested, not written, and the game asked for EQUAL. RX_VK_EQ_BIAS=<units> chooses it on any GPU, 0 turns it off.
