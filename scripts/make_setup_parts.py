"""The parts HookshotBuilder-Setup.exe downloads (builder/setup/setup.c), from a Hookshot Builder package folder.

    python -I scripts/make_setup_parts.py <package folder> <tag> <out folder> [--base <url the parts are served from>]
                                          [--reuse <an earlier release's hookshot-setup.txt>]

A release is split by how often each part changes, so an update downloads only what changed: the builder's own code (a few MB)
in every release, the .NET runtime, Python, emsdk, the CPM packages and third_party only when they change. llvm-mingw comes from
its official release. Each zip is deterministic (sorted names, fixed dates and attributes): a part whose files did not change
has the same SHA-256 in the next release, and the setup takes it from its download cache instead of downloading it again.

Writes <out>/hookshot-setup.txt and one HookshotBuilder-<part>-<sha256 prefix>.zip per part (upload the ones the builder-parts
release lacks). Scripts the build does not use (.ps1, .bat, .js,
.html: antivirus machine-learning guesses fire on them) are left out.

--reuse: a part whose tools/<name> folder the package lacks is taken from that list as it is (its line, with its URL), so a
package made in CI (.github/workflows/windows-builder.yml) carries the Python, emsdk, CPM and wgpu-native parts the maintainer
made. Without the folder and without the part in that list it is an error.
