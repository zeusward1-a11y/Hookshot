Hookshot is a static recompilation. The game's code is translated to C and compiled into a Windows or Linux program,
the console's system software is reimplemented, and the Switch 2 graphics are rebuilt on Vulkan. All of this happens
**on your PC, from your own copy of the game**.

## Project status

Experimental. Most testing so far has been around the start of the game. Players have reported on many PCs since:
the table says what works and what does not yet.

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Kokiri Forest: reaching gameplay and walking around | ✅ Works |
| Sound, controller, keyboard and saves | ✅ Works |
| In-game menu, frame generation and upscaling | ✅ Works |
| Flicker (the picture flashing too bright while moving) | ✅ Fixed in v2.0.2 ([#645](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/pull/645)) |
| Ground fog vanishing when looking down | ✅ Fixed in v2.0.2 ([#638](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/pull/638)) |
| Models with missing pieces (doors, fences, parts of trees) | ✅ Fixed where tested, more play needed |
| Stutter when entering new areas | ⚠️ Still happens the first time you visit a place. The next visits are smooth |
| Performance | ⚠️ Depends on the PC: some reach a steady 60 fps, others stay below it, more so in Hyrule Field |
| Hyrule Field, Castle Town, Kakariko and the dungeons | ⚠️ Players got there, with open bugs: striped shadows in Hyrule Field ([#468](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/468)), some crashes ([#317](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/317), [#648](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/648)) |
| Ultrawide and 4:3 | ⚠️ The 3D keeps its shape, but the HUD is stretched and the picture is softer |
| NVIDIA cards | ✅ Works. The most tested |
| AMD cards | ⚠️ Some tested: reports from the RX 6600, RX 7800 XT and RX 7900 XTX. Known issue: the game loses the GPU in the Deku Tree on the RX 6600 ([#708](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/708), [#614](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/614)) |
| Intel cards | ❓ Few reports, many of them black screens or crashes ([#17](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/17)) |
| Cards without mesh shaders (such as AMD RX 5000 and older) | ❌ Not supported: parts of the picture are missing. Since v2.0.6 a fallback runs the mesh programs as compute shaders on cards with buffer device addresses ([#640](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/640)); it leaves out the mesh draws that take their count from a buffer |
| Linux | ✅ Works with the AppImage. Tested on several distributions (CachyOS, Fedora, Bazzite, SteamOS) and cards, with open problems on some AMD cards ([#604](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/604), [#528](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/528)) |

## Install and play

The game does not come ready-made: Hookshot Builder builds it on your PC from your copy. You do this once. After that
you start the game from its launcher, which also updates it.

### What you need

- **Your copy of the game at the supported version:** program `0400486024DEC000`, update v131072, build `e0f3ccfa`.
  Other versions do not work. A `.nup` file, or the `romfs` and `exefs` folders.
- 64-bit Windows 10 or 11, or 64-bit Linux with glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora, Arch,
  SteamOS ...) and a CPU with AVX2. The Linux AppImage needs AVX2; on Windows, and in a build from source, a CPU
  without it gets a game built for what it has, a little slower.
- A graphics card with Vulkan 1.3 and mesh shaders, with an up-to-date driver: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 series or newer,
  AMD Radeon RX 6000 series or newer, or Intel Arc. On Linux, Mesa or NVIDIA's driver. Cards without mesh shaders are
  not supported.
- 8 GB of video memory (VRAM) or more is recommended. Cards with less can use the in-game menu's lower Quality presets.
- 16 GB of RAM or more. A run uses about 10 GB.
- About 60 GB free while building.
- An internet connection for the download. Nothing else to install: the builder brings its own compiler and tools.

### On Windows

1. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/releases/latest) and download `HookshotBuilder.exe`.
2. Run it. It downloads the rest of Hookshot Builder (about 500 MB), checks it, and opens it.
3. Pick your game. The builder looks for `.nup` files in your Downloads, Desktop and Documents folders and lists them
   under **Found on this PC**. Not listed? Press **Browse…**, drop the file on the window, or choose
   **romfs and exefs folders**. The builder checks that it is the right version.
4. Under **Install the game to**, keep the folder (`Games\Hookshot` in your user folder) or press **Change**. Choose
   the **Game language**.
5. Press **Build the game**. It takes about 10 to 45 minutes, depending on your CPU and memory. You can use your PC in
   the meantime.
6. When it says **Your game is ready**, press **Play**. The **Desktop shortcut** and **Start menu entry** boxes are
   ticked: untick them if you don't want them.

Next time, start the game from the Hookshot shortcut, or `hookshot.exe` in the game folder. That is the launcher: it
has **Play**, and **Update** when a newer release is out.

The first start prepares the game's shaders, which takes a while. Later starts are faster.

### On Linux

1. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/releases/latest) and download
   `Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`. It is Hookshot Builder with everything it needs inside.
2. Allow it to run as a program. In most file managers: right-click it, open **Properties**, and turn on
   "Allow executing file as program" (the words differ between desktops). Or in a terminal:
   `chmod +x Hookshot-*-x86_64.AppImage`.
3. Double-click it. The Hookshot Builder window opens.
4. Under **Game files**, choose **.nup file** or **romfs and exefs**, then press **Browse** to pick them. The builder
   checks the version.
5. Under **Save the game to**, keep `~/Games/Hookshot` or choose another folder. Choose a **Language**.
6. Press **Build**. It takes about 10 to 45 minutes, depending on your CPU and memory.
7. When it says "Your game is ready", press **Play**.

The game is also added to your applications menu as "Hookshot". That entry, and `hookshot` in the game folder, open the
launcher: **Play**, and **Update** when a newer release is out. Keep the AppImage where it is: the launcher uses it to
update.

The same AppImage also builds and starts the game without opening the window, for a machine you reach over SSH or for a
script: see [Linux, the AppImage from the command line](#build-from-source).

### Updating

When a new release is out, the launcher says "Update available". Press **Update**: in `hookshot.exe` on Windows, or in
`hookshot` (or the AppImage) on Linux. It downloads only the parts that changed and builds the game again in the same
folder. The build files of the last build are gone by then (see [Where the files go](#where-the-files-go)), so an
update takes about as long as the first build. Your saves and settings are kept. What changed is on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/releases).

<details>
<summary>What an update keeps and replaces, and updating from the command line</summary>

To be safe, copy your saves somewhere first: the `user` folder in the game folder on Windows, or
`~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux.

| Kept | Replaced |
|---|---|
| Your saves (`user`, or `~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux) | The game in `bin` and its files |
| `hookshot_options.ini`, the in-game menu's choices and your controls | `image.bin` and the shader list |
| `hookshot_env.txt` | `language.txt`, written again with the game's language |
| `mods` | |

The game files the first build read are kept in the game folder, so an update does not need your `.nup` again.

From a clone: `git pull`, then `python -I nx2/make_game.py --update <game folder>`. The Linux AppImage does the same
with `--update <game folder>`.

</details>

### Where the files go

- The build reads your game and never changes it. It writes to the folder you choose and to the builder's own folder:
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder` on Windows, `~/.cache/hookshot-builder` on Linux.
- The romfs is hard-linked instead of copied where the disk allows it.
- The build files (about 4 GB: the translated code and the compiled objects) are deleted once the game is ready. None
  of them are needed to play. To keep them, so that an update compiles only what changed, set the environment variable
  `HOOKSHOT_KEEP_BUILD_FILES=1` for the builder; on Windows, **Free up space** on the "Your game is ready" page then
  deletes them when you want. The build files folder can be moved before a build (**Change**, **Default**).
- Saves: the `user` folder in the game folder on Windows, `~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux (a `user` folder from an
  earlier Linux build is moved there once). `--user <folder>` puts them somewhere else ([command line
  arguments](#running-the-game-from-the-command-line)).
  To carry on with a save from an emulator (Lichii, Eglantine, Orchid, ...) or NX2navi, or to take yours there, see
  [using a save from an emulator](docs/saves.md).
- To uninstall, delete the game folder, the builder's folder and the shortcuts.

### If something goes wrong

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| Where is the log? | `hookshot_log.txt` in the game folder holds the last run. The four runs before are `hookshot_log.1.txt` (the last) to `.4.txt`. Started from a terminal, the game prints there instead. Every 600 frames it has a `vk: status:` line: the video memory in use of what the driver allows, and DLSS's details while it draws; `vk: over the driver's video-memory allowance` says when the game passed it |
| "Hookshot supports build e0f3ccfa" or "This version isn't supported" | Check that you chose the right game with its update installed |
| The game opens and closes, or the log says "device lost" | Update your graphics driver. On AMD cards there are known crashes ([#708](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/708), [#614](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/614)) |
| Parts of the picture are missing, or a message says your card has no mesh shader support | The card or its driver has no mesh shaders. Update the driver; older cards are not supported ([#640](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/640)) |
| AMD: blocky textures, solid rectangles in the sky or unusually dark courtyard surfaces | Try the [RGBA8 texture workaround](#amd-texture-workaround). It uses more graphics memory |
| Linux: the game does not start or the picture is broken | The game needs a Vulkan 1.3 driver with mesh shaders. Check with `vulkaninfo \| grep mesh`: it should list `VK_EXT_mesh_shader`. Update Mesa or the NVIDIA driver |
| Steam Deck: the game freezes and closes in Kokiri Forest or the Great Deku Tree (`gfx_0.0.0 timeout` in `journalctl -k`) | `RX_VK_MESH_NOCULL=2c56dc1006942f74` in `hookshot_env.txt` gets past it with every model drawn (the culling pass that runs for seconds is turned off). `RX_VK_SKIP_CODE=2c56dc1006942f74` also gets past it, but the models those draws make go missing (see the [development guide](docs/development.md#switches-for-testing-and-debugging), [#817](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/817)) |
| "Your antivirus removed part of the build tools" | A false alarm on unsigned programs. Restore the files from Windows Security's Protection history, or add `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder` to its exclusions, then press **Repair** |
| Stutter the first time you see something | Normal for now: shaders are being prepared. It gets better when you pass through the same place again |
| The game is in the wrong language | Change the code in `language.txt` in the game folder. The file lists them all |

If the problem continues, [report it](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/new/choose) with the version, where
you were in the game, your graphics card, `hookshot_log.txt` and a screenshot or video. Never send game files.

#### AMD texture workaround

For these AMD texture artifacts, try keeping decoded ASTC textures as RGBA8 instead of re-encoding them to BC3
([#57](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/57), [#1006](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/1006)).
Close the game, then create or edit `hookshot_env.txt` in the built game folder, beside `image.bin`, and add:

```ini
RX_VK_ASTC_RGBA8=1
```

Restart the game. The same setting applies when Steam or RecompLauncher starts that game folder.

This is a workaround for some artifacts, not a general lighting fix. It can substantially increase graphics-memory
use and cause stalls when the card runs out of headroom. To undo it, remove that line and restart the game.

## In-game menu

By default, press <kbd>Insert</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd> in game. On a controller, press Home or Select and Start together.
The same keys close it, and so does <kbd>Esc</kbd>. Use **Controls → Menu shortcut** to leave either keyboard shortcut
free for another overlay. The menu has four tabs, Graphics, Gameplay, Controls and Debug:
<kbd>Q</kbd> and <kbd>E</kbd> (or <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>) switch between them, LB and RB on
a controller (or the triggers). <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> choose a row, <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd>
change it (<kbd>Enter</kbd> changes it too); beside the rows, the help says what the row is and, on a line of its own,
what the value chosen does. On a controller the D-pad chooses and changes, A changes too and opens a page (Motion,
Controls, the Teleport list, the inventory), and B goes back or closes the menu: A and B are the buttons your layout puts the Switch's A and B
on (with the Nintendo layout, A is the right face button). The mouse is free while the menu is open: click a tab, click the left or right half of a
value to lower or raise it, drag a slider, turn the wheel to scroll the rows (it never changes a value), and right-click to go back. The
button prompts at the bottom show the keys or the controller's buttons, whichever you used last. Your choices are saved
in `hookshot_options.ini` in the game folder.

The menu, the FPS counter and the start-up screen are drawn in the style of the game's own menus. They use the game's
own menu font, read into memory from your game files (the romfs folder the game runs from) the first time one of them is
drawn. It is never copied anywhere, and Hookshot does not include it. Without it, or if it has no Latin letters, they use
Libertinus, which Hookshot includes.

The rows marked "after a restart" below are read when the game starts. While one is changed, it is tagged "After
restart" and the help on the Graphics tab lists it; closing the menu then asks whether to restart now. **Later** keeps
the change for the next start (and is not asked again until you change one of those rows); **Restart now** saves your
choices and starts the game again, so progress since your last save is lost.

- **Quality preset** sets Render resolution, Window scaling filter, Sharpness, Frame pacing, Game speed, Handheld
  profile and the video memory limits for a card with that much memory. It leaves the Upscaler and Frame generation as
  you chose them: with DLSS, the preset's resolution becomes DLSS's nearest mode. Changing most other rows yourself
  sets it back to Custom.
- **Menu size** is how large the menu, the FPS counter and the start-up screen are drawn. Auto is Large in fullscreen on a
  screen of 1080 lines or more while you use a controller (a TV across the room), else Medium.
- **GPU device** matters on a PC with more than one graphics card (a laptop's integrated and dedicated GPUs, or a
  second card for Lossless Scaling). Auto prefers a dedicated one, and only cards with Vulkan 1.3 are listed.
  `hookshot_log.txt` lists every card as `vk: device <n>`; `RX_VK_DEVICE=<n>` chooses one for a single run and wins
  over the menu.
- **Frame generation** makes extra frames between the game's own. It adds a little input delay, and fast motion can
  show artifacts. At 2x, AMD FSR 3.1's frame interpolation makes the frame where it runs (below); at 3x and more, and
  where it does not run, the renderer's own does. **Frame pacing** shows frames at an even interval: less stutter, up to one frame of delay. It paces
  the frames that frame generation shows, so it has no effect while Frame generation is Off.
- **The scaling rows**, in the picture's order: **Output resolution** is the size of the game's whole frame, HUD
  included. The **Upscaler** fills it from the 3D: the game's own network, NVIDIA DLSS or DLAA (the 3D at full size,
  edges smoothed), or AMD FSR 3.1 (below). DLSS and DLAA look softer than the game's own: set **Sharpness** to around
  80% with them. **DLSS model**
  chooses their network (below). **Render
  resolution** is the 3D's share of the output. The **Window scaling filter** then scales the frame to your window,
  and **Sharpness** sharpens it, by the picture's pixels: when the window is much larger than the picture (the Handheld
  profile's 1536x864 on a 4K screen), a Sharpness kept from an older version is stronger than it was, so a lower one may
  suit.
- **Output resolution:** its rows below show the sizes for the output you chose. Docked only. On a 1920x1080 display,
  the 1920x1080 option keeps HUD and text sharp when the game fills the screen by mapping them pixel for pixel. At
  3840x2160 the game's render targets get a bigger GPU pool, so a full-size 3D fits. On a 5120x1440 (32:9) ultrawide
  monitor, 5120x1440 gives a native frame with a sharp HUD. Set **Ultrawide** to Monitor's shape with it: it widens the
  cameras to the frame's shape and keeps the HUD and movies in the middle 16:9; without it, the game's 16:9 picture is
  stretched across the 32:9 output, sharp but wide. For one run, set `HOS_OUTPUT_RES` to `3` for 1920x1080,
  `0` for 2048x1152, `1` for 2560x1440, `2` for 3840x2160, or `4` for 5120x1440.
- **Window scaling filter** matters only when your window's size differs from the Output resolution: for the sharpest
  picture, set the Output resolution to your screen's, and the row shows "Not needed (window = output)". It and
  **Sharpness** also work when Frame generation is Off.
- **NVIDIA Reflex** Off is the game as without it. `RX_VK_REFLEX_LOG=1` logs the driver's latency timings every 300
  frames while it is on.
- **Handheld profile** runs the game as if the console were undocked: lower resolution, lighter on the GPU.
- **Robust buffers:** a read past a buffer's end is dropped instead of stopping the GPU. Auto is on, on every card; Off
  can be faster on some NVIDIA cards.
- **Game speed:** with Per frame, the game runs slower whenever it is below 60 fps. Real time keeps it at normal speed
  down to 15 fps.
- **FPS counter** shows in the top right corner. With frame generation on, it also shows the game's own rate.
- **Audio output** is the speakers the game mixes its sound for. Auto is 5.1 when your default output device has 5.1
  or more speakers, else stereo; Stereo or 5.1 chooses one whatever the device has (5.1 on stereo speakers is mixed
  down). For one run, `HOS_AUDIO_CHANNELS=2` or `6` chooses stereo or 5.1 and wins over the menu.
- **Microphone** is what the ocarina hears when the game's own microphone option is on (an instrument, or humming).
  Default follows Windows' default recording device; the list shows each microphone by name, and a change applies at
  once. A chosen microphone that is unplugged stays chosen (shown as not connected): Default stands in until it is
  back. On Linux (SDL2) two microphones with the same name cannot be told apart: the first is used. Windows must allow desktop apps to use the microphone
  (Settings, Privacy & security, Microphone). `HOS_MIC_LOG=1` logs what the game reads, a line a second.
- **Controller in background:** On keeps the controller working while another window has the focus. The keyboard and
  mouse still need the game's window.
- **Mouse camera:** Native turns the camera with the mouse one to one, as in a PC game. As the stick uses the mouse in
  place of the right stick. The <kbd>-</kbd> and <kbd>=</kbd> keys change the sensitivity in game too.
- **Stick dead zone:** how far a stick moves before it counts, on each axis. Default is XInput's (about 24%); lower suits
  a precise stick, higher one that drifts. The game keeps a dead zone of its own after it.
- **Rumble strength** scales the controller's rumble: 100% is the game's own, Off turns it off. The game's HD rumble
  goes to a controller's heavy and light motors by its frequency.
- **Motion controls** (Controls tab, Motion page): the controller's gyroscope aims where the game uses motion, as on the Switch. It works with
  Switch Pro controllers and pads in Switch mode, DualSense and DualShock 4 (through SDL). Its row
  says whether the connected pad has a gyroscope; Off leaves the game seeing a pad lying still. **Motion sensitivity X/Y**
  scale the left-right and up-down aim (100% is the console's), **Invert motion X/Y** turn either direction around. The game gets the motion
  state as a Switch (and Eden) builds it, so how you hold the pad when motion starts does not matter. Motion follows the pad used
  last. The gyroscope's drift is learned while the pad rests on a table, so set it down for a second if the aim
  creeps. `HOS_MOTION_DEBUG=1` (in `hookshot_env.txt`) logs what the game gets twice a second.
- **Layout preset:** Nintendo has A on the right face button, Xbox / PC and Swap Face put A on the bottom one. Changing
  a button yourself sets it to Custom.

### Controls

Use a controller, or the keyboard and mouse. On the keyboard, <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> move
and the arrow keys (or <kbd>I</kbd> <kbd>J</kbd> <kbd>K</kbd> <kbd>L</kbd>) turn the camera.
With the default keyboard bindings, press <kbd>E</kbd> to select **New Game** on the title screen.

**Rumble:** a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or Joy-Con plays the game's HD rumble as the Switch does, each side and
both frequency bands as the game asks, with SDL3 (the Windows game brings it; on Linux the system's SDL3, where it has
one). Other controllers, Switch 2 controllers, a pair of Joy-Cons used as one controller, and SDL2's own library get
the game's rumble on their two motors. The menu's Rumble strength scales it too. `HOS_HD_RUMBLE=0` sends the Switch
controllers the motor rumble too. On Linux, SDL talks to the Switch controller itself through its hidraw device, which
needs read and write access for your user; Steam's udev rules (the `steam-devices` package on most distributions) give
it. Without them the kernel's hid-nintendo driver runs the controller, and it gets the motor rumble. HD rumble goes to
anything SDL reports as a Switch Pro Controller or Joy-Con, and that includes third-party controllers in Switch mode
(8BitDo, GameSir and others; SDL gives them Nintendo's ids). Some of them may turn it into weak rumble or none: set
`HOS_HD_RUMBLE=0` to give them the plain motor rumble.

To change which gamepad button or key presses a Switch button, or which keys move and turn the camera, open the
Controls tab's Controls page. Choose a row and a column (Gamepad or Keyboard), press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or the bottom
face button), then the new button or key. <kbd>Esc</kbd> cancels, <kbd>Delete</kbd> clears it, and Reset to defaults
puts them all back. A gamepad button taken from another Switch button swaps with it. The page saves them in
`hookshot_options.ini`.

<details>
<summary>Writing the controls in hookshot_options.ini yourself</summary>

```ini
pad_a=0
key_a=69,13
```

`pad_<button>` is a gamepad input by position: 0 bottom face button, 1 right, 2 left, 3 top, 4 Select or Back, 5 Home,
6 Start, 7 and 8 the stick presses, 9 and 10 the shoulder buttons, 11 to 14 the D-pad (up, down, left, right), 15 and
16 the triggers, -1 none. `key_<button>` is one or two
[Windows key codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) in decimal (69 is
<kbd>E</kbd>, 13 <kbd>Enter</kbd>), 0 none; the mouse's buttons are 1 (left), 2 (right), 4 (middle), 5 and 6 (side
buttons), and count while the mouse is captured. The buttons are `a` `b` `x` `y` `l` `r` `zl` `zr` `plus` `minus` `ls`
`rs` `left` `up` `right` `down`, and for keys only the left stick's and the camera's directions: `move_up`
`move_down` `move_left` `move_right` `cam_up` `cam_down` `cam_left` `cam_right`. A button the file leaves out keeps
its default.

## Mods

Put mods in a `mods` folder in the game folder, beside `hookshot.exe` (or point `HOS_MODS` at another folder), in the
layout emulators use: `mods/<name>/romfs/...` holds files that replace or add to the game's own. Deeper layouts such as
`mods/contents/<title id>/<name>/romfs` work too. A folder whose name starts with `-` or `_` is off. When two mods
have the same file, the one whose folder name sorts last wins, so name them `01-...`, `02-...` to set the order.

Only RomFS mods are loaded. `exefs` patches (`.pchtxt`, `.ips`) are left out: Hookshot compiles the game's code ahead
of time, so patching its instructions would need a rebuild. The log (`hookshot_log.txt`) names each mod and the files
read from it.

A mod file larger than the game's own does not load unless the resource size table allows for it:
`System/Resource/ResourceSizeTable.Product.111.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.rsizetable.zs` gives each file the memory the game sets
aside for it (by the CRC32 of its path without `.zs`; for a texture, its decompressed size + 280). Past that, the game
goes on without the mod's file, or a loading screen waits for good. A mod that makes files bigger (HD
textures, longer parameter files) ships the table with its entries grown. Since only one mod's table is used, mods that
each grow files need one table with all their entries, in the mod that sorts last.

## Build from source

For developers, and for players who prefer the command line. The builder windows run the same script,
`nx2/make_game.py`. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has more.

<details>
<summary>Windows, from the command line</summary>

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --nup "C:\path\your-game.nup" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
python -I nx2/make_game.py --romfs "C:\path\romfs" --exefs "C:\path\exefs" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Add `--check` with your `.nup` or `--exefs` to only check the game's version. It builds nothing.
Add `--log "C:\path\build.log"` to also save the build's output to a file (UTF-8, replaced if it exists); it works
with `--check` and `--update` too, and on Linux.
`HOOKSHOT_JOBS=<n>` (or `--jobs <n>`) limits how many files compile at once.

You need:

- Python 3 from python.org (the Microsoft Store's Python installs packages where `python -I` does not look), with
  `pip install lz4 numpy capstone "unicorn>=2.1,<2.2" zstandard`, and `pip install -r nx2/prompt_requirements.txt` for
  the button prompts of other controllers.
- [llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) (the `ucrt-x86_64` build), unpacked as `llvm-mingw` in the
  clone or with `HOOKSHOT_MINGW` set to its folder. Without it the build uses the clang from
  [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) at `C:\emsdk` with Visual Studio's C++ tools and the Windows SDK
  (`HOOKSHOT_MSVC=1` forces that route).
- What the builder's `tools` folder carries and a clone does not. Run `HookshotBuilder.exe` once: the folder is
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder\versions\<version>\HookshotBuilder\tools`. The builder sets the variables itself;
  from the command line, set them before you run `make_game.py`:
  - `tools\cpm`: the Vulkan headers and FFmpeg. Set `RX_CPM` to this folder. Without it the build leaves out
    `hookshot_vk.dll`, the Vulkan renderer, and says nothing.
  - `tools\wgpu-native`: set `WGPU_NATIVE` to this folder.
  - `tools\third_party`: the prebuilt files a clone lacks (`a64emit`, `lld-link`, `zbic` and SDL2). Copy its `.dll`,
    `.exe`, `.lib` and `.sha1` files to the same places under `third_party\`.
  - `tools\work`: copy it to `work\`. It holds the hot-function list, the link order, the profile and the icon;
    without them the game builds but runs slower.
- Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 8, only if you want to change the builder itself.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux, the AppImage from the command line</summary>

```sh
./Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage --cli --nup ~/your-game.nup --out ~/Games/Hookshot   # make_game.py's options
./Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage --play                    # the game the builder built last, without the window
./Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage --play ~/Games/Hookshot   # the game in that folder
./Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage --update ~/Games/Hookshot # the new release, and that folder built again
```

`HOOKSHOT_JOBS=<n>` (or `--jobs <n>` with `--cli`) limits how many files compile at once.

In a game folder, `hookshot` is the launcher and the game itself is `bin/hookshot`. The builder's settings are in
`~/.config/hookshot/builder.ini`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux, without the AppImage</summary>

You need `clang` and `lld` (LLVM 23 or newer reads the play profile; an older one builds without it), Python 3 with
`lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `unicorn` and `zstandard` (and `nx2/prompt_requirements.txt`'s, for the button prompts),
FFmpeg's development files (with dav1d, for the movies) and
SDL3 (SDL2 works too). Then run `python -I nx2/make_game.py ...` as on Windows, with `RX_CPM` pointing at a folder with Vulkan-Headers,
SPIRV-Headers and VulkanMemoryAllocator in CPM's layout.

`scripts/linux/deps.sh` fetches and builds all of these into `build-linux/deps`, and `scripts/linux/appimage.sh` makes
the AppImage from them. A folder built from a source checkout has no launcher: `hookshot` there is the game.

</details>

<details>
<summary>The Windows game, built on Linux</summary>

Unpack llvm-mingw's Linux build (`ucrt-ubuntu-22.04-x86_64`), then run `make_game.py` with `RX_TARGET=windows` and
`HOOKSHOT_MINGW` set to its folder. The objects go to `~/.cache/hookshot-builder-windows`, apart from the Linux game's.
The game folder runs under Proton or on Windows.

</details>

### Running the game from the command line

The built game is `bin\hookshot.exe` on Windows and `bin/hookshot` in a packaged Linux game folder. A build from a
source checkout has `hookshot.exe` or `hookshot` in its build folder, with no launcher beside it. The `hookshot.exe`
or `hookshot` launcher in the game folder does not pass these arguments to the game, so start the game directly to
use them.

| Argument | What it does |
|---|---|
| `image.bin` | The game image to run. Without it the game uses the `image.bin`, `romfs` and `user` in its folder |
| `--romfs <folder>` | The extracted RomFS folder |
| `--user <folder>` | Where the game keeps per-user data: saves, caches and temp files (and `mouse_sens.txt` when `HOS_MOUSE_SENS` is set; the menu keeps the sensitivity otherwise). Default: `user` in the game folder on Windows, `~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux; with an explicit image path, `user` in the current folder |
| `--trace` | Log every Horizon OS call (the same as `HOS_TRACE=1`) |
| `--prepare-shaders` | Prepare the shaders as the first start does, then exit without starting the game (no build step runs it) |

For example, keep saves somewhere else:

```powershell
cd "C:\Games\Hookshot"
.\bin\hookshot.exe --user "D:\Hookshot data"
```

```sh
cd ~/Games/Hookshot
./bin/hookshot --user "$HOME/hookshot-data"
```

`hookshot_env.txt` and the other test switches are documented below.

<details>
<summary>AMD FSR 3.1 (every build)</summary>

**AMD FSR 3.1** in the Graphics tab's **Upscaler** row (`dlss=3` in `hookshot_options.ini`; `RX_VK_FSR=1` for one run,
`RX_VK_FSR=0` never) upscales in place of the game's own network, and with **Frame generation** at 2x its frame
interpolation makes the frame in between (`RX_VK_FSR_FG=0` leaves that to the renderer's own). Both are AMD's FidelityFX
SDK 1.1.4 shaders (`third_party/fidelityfx-sdk`, MIT), compiled into the renderer: no AMD runtime or DLL is needed, and
the row offers FSR 3.1 on any Vulkan 1.3 GPU with push descriptors, extended storage image formats and storage writes
without a format (`vk: fsr3: ... can run on this GPU` in the log). Its inputs are the scene's colour, its depth, motion
from the camera, and the same camera jitter DLSS uses (`RX_VK_FSR_JITTER=0` turns it off); things that move by
themselves can trail for now.

</details>

<details>
<summary>NVIDIA DLSS (optional, NVIDIA's SDK under NVIDIA's license)</summary>

A game built with NVIDIA's DLSS SDK offers **NVIDIA DLSS** and **NVIDIA DLAA** in the Graphics tab's **Upscaler** row on
NVIDIA RTX cards (`dlss=` in `hookshot_options.ini`, `RX_VK_DLSS=0/1/2` for one run): DLSS Super Resolution in place of
the game's own upscaler, with camera jitter (**NVIDIA Reflex** needs no SDK and is in
every build). NVIDIA's files are NVIDIA's, under its own license, the
[NVIDIA RTX SDKs license](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/blob/9981c6350dc58c0ce21f024fd65e31e851c31689/LICENSE.txt).
Hookshot never includes or redistributes them: each build downloads them for itself, and only after you accept that
license. Never share a game folder built with them, and do not post builds made with them.

- **Windows, the Hookshot Builder:** tick **NVIDIA DLSS (downloads NVIDIA's SDK under NVIDIA's license)** before you
  build. It is off by default and shows NVIDIA's license when you tick it. The build downloads the SDK into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder\ngx-sdk` and puts DLSS's runtime, `nvngx_dlss.dll`, in the game folder's `ngx` folder.
- **Windows, the command line:** `python -I scripts/ngx_sdk.py --platform windows <sdk folder>` asks you to accept
  NVIDIA's license (or pass `--accept-nvidia-license`) and fetches the headers, `nvsdk_ngx_s.lib` and `nvngx_dlss.dll`,
  each checked against its SHA-256. Then build with `HOOKSHOT_NGX_SDK=<sdk folder>`: `make_game.py` copies
  `nvngx_dlss.dll` into `<game folder>\ngx`. NGX is also pointed at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hookshot\ngx`, and at
  `RX_VK_DLSS_DIR` when it is set, and uses the newest `nvngx_dlss.dll` it finds across them (to try a given one, make
  sure no other folder has a newer one). Never copy NGX's core, `_nvngx.dll`, beside the game: it comes with NVIDIA's
  driver.
- **Linux:** the same with `--platform linux` (or `scripts/linux/ngx-sdk.sh`): `libnvsdk_ngx.a` for the build and
  `libnvidia-ngx-dlss.so` for the game folder's `ngx` folder (also looked for in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hookshot/ngx`). NGX's
  core comes with NVIDIA's Linux driver. NVIDIA's NGX on Linux loads the runtime only from a folder whose path is all
  ASCII: with the game in a folder named otherwise (`~/Games/Zelda-Café`), put `libnvidia-ngx-dlss.so.*` in
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hookshot/ngx` (`~/.local/share/hookshot/ngx`) or another ASCII folder named by `RX_VK_DLSS_DIR`.

The **DLSS model** row chooses DLSS's network, by NVIDIA's preset letter, for every mode: **Transformer (K)**, the
transformer model and the one tested most here (the default); **Transformer 2 (M)**, NVIDIA's second-generation
transformer as it picks it for Performance; **Transformer 2 (L)**, the same generation as tuned for Ultra Performance;
**NVIDIA default**, which lets DLSS's runtime pick for each mode, so it can change with a runtime update. The runtime
the SDK comes with (310.9.16) has all of them. A change applies at once, without a restart (`dlss_model=` in
`hookshot_options.ini`, 0 to 3 in that order). `RX_VK_DLSS_PRESET=<letter>` (or `0` for NVIDIA's default) chooses
the preset for one run and wins over the row; the log's `vk: NVIDIA DLSS: ... preset <letter>` line says which one was
asked for, and with `RX_VK_DLSS_LOG=1` NGX's own `Using App hint Preset <letter>` lines say which it took.

**8 GB cards:** DLAA draws the 3D at full size, and DLSS and DLAA add images of their own beside the game's. In busy
areas that can pass what the driver allows the game, and the game then stutters: Quality or Balanced is safer there.
The log's `vk: status:` line every 600 frames shows the video memory in use of the allowance, with DLSS's details
(its images' size, the jitter and the actor motion) appended while it draws, and a `vk: over the driver's
video-memory allowance` line says when the game passed it.

The game's log says whether DLSS started, and why not when it did not (`vk: NVIDIA DLSS:` lines in `hookshot_log.txt`).
NGX starts on demand: when the Insert menu first opens (to know whether the Upscaler can offer DLSS) or at the first
gameplay upscale with DLSS chosen, so on the title screen the log has no NGX lines yet.
With `RX_VK_DLSS_LOG=1` NGX's own lines go there too (`ngx:`). Some of them look like errors but are not:
`failed to load NGXCore: 126` (twice) is NVIDIA's library looking for `_nvngx.dll` and `nvngx.dll` beside the game, which
are not there on purpose, before it loads the driver's; `Feature ... failed to load from cache` is NGX finding no model
of its own downloads (`C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA\NGX\models`) before it uses the game folder's `nvngx_dlss.dll`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation (optional, NVIDIA's Streamline files under NVIDIA's license)</summary>

The Graphics tab's **DLSS Frame Generation** row (`dlss_frame_generation=` in `hookshot_options.ini`, `RX_DLSSG=0/2/3/4` for one
run) turns on NVIDIA's own frame generation, DLSS-G, in place of the **Frame generation** row's. It is another thing than that
row: there the frames are made by Hookshot's own passes; here NVIDIA's model makes them from the game's depth, motion vectors
and camera, and the driver paces them together with NVIDIA Reflex. It is off by default, and nothing of it is loaded while it
is off.

- **What it needs:** an NVIDIA RTX 40 or 50 series card, Windows, **NVIDIA DLSS** or **NVIDIA DLAA** as the **Upscaler** (the
  section above: the frames are made from what DLSS is given), and NVIDIA's Streamline files, which are not part of Hookshot.
- **The files:** from NVIDIA's Streamline SDK 2.14.16 (https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline/releases/tag/v2.14.16,
  `streamline-sdk-v2.14.16.zip`), its `bin/x64` folder (the production one, not `development`), into a `streamline` folder
  beside `hookshot.exe`. It was tested with these nine there: `sl.interposer.dll`, `sl.common.dll`, `sl.dlss_g.dll`,
  `sl.reflex.dll`, `sl.pcl.dll`, `sl.dlss.dll`, `nvngx_dlssg.dll`, `nvngx_dlss.dll`, `NvLowLatencyVk.dll`. Using them is
  accepting the license NVIDIA ships with the SDK. `RX_DLSS_DIR=<folder>` names another folder.
- **Turning it on:** set the row to 2x, 3x or 4x and restart (Streamline is started before the game's window is made). The log
  then says `vk: dlssg: available`, and in play, every 600 presents, `vk: dlssg: ... frames shown per game frame`.
- **While it is on:** the **Frame generation**, **Frame pacing** and **NVIDIA Reflex** rows are shown without their arrows:
  DLSS Frame Generation makes the frames, paces them and brings Streamline's Reflex, so Hookshot's own interpolation and Reflex
  stand aside. The DLSS upscaling is untouched (it stays NGX's).
- **The window:** presented without vsync while it is on (DLSS Frame Generation asks for that; G-SYNC works through the
  driver), with Reflex holding what is shown just under the display's refresh rate. Nothing has to be changed in the NVIDIA
  Control Panel or the NVIDIA app.
- **Switches** (`hookshot_env.txt`): `RX_DLSSG_LIMIT=present` (the default: Reflex's limit counts every frame shown), `game`
  (the game's frames; on the test PC this held the game at half the limit at 2x) or `0` (no limit); `RX_DLSSG_FPS=<n>` caps
  the game's own frames; `RX_DLSS_NO_OTA=1` keeps Streamline to the files in its folder; `RX_DLSS_LOG=2` for Streamline's
  verbose log.
- **Tested on:** one PC, an RTX 5070 (12 GB) on Windows 11 with a 165 Hz display, at 2x: every made frame shown (2.00 frames
  shown per game frame). 3x and 4x, other cards and Linux were not tested; Streamline is Windows only, so on Linux the row
  does nothing.
- **RTX 20 and 30 series:** not enabled. DLSS Frame Generation is NVIDIA's for RTX 40 and 50; this is the standard
  integration, so the unlockers the community already uses for older cards may work on top of it, but that was not tried
  (no such card to test with).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Switches for testing (hookshot_env.txt)</summary>

Switches to test (`RX_VK_NOOPT=1` and the others) go in `hookshot_env.txt` in the game folder, one `NAME=VALUE` a
line, on Windows and Linux. The running game reads it, not the builder. A test run can name another file with
`HOS_ENV_FILE=<path>`; the game then reads that one instead and leaves `hookshot_env.txt` alone.
`hookshot_env.txt` sets only the game's own switches (names that start with `RX_`, `HOS_`, `HOOKSHOT_`, `EDEN_`,
`NVN_`, `TOTK_` or `SDL_`, but not SDL's library names such as `SDL_VULKAN_LIBRARY`), and no value that is a path except
`RX_VK_DLSS_DIR`'s (a folder on this PC, not a network share), and no file name for the switches that write one;
other lines are left out, and the
log says so. Switches that need a path, or other variables, go in a file named by `HOS_ENV_FILE`.

To enable the debug tools, turn **Debug tools** on in the menu's Debug tab (or add `HOS_OOT_CHEATS=1` to
`hookshot_env.txt` in the game folder). The tools then show below it on the same tab. The tab's Developer section,
always shown, has the Descriptor reuse and Sampler cache rows.

`RX_VK_UI_GAME_FONT=0` draws the menu with the included font (Libertinus) even when the game's files have the game's own
menu font. `RX_VK_UI_PROMPTS=pad` (or `keys`) shows the controller's (or the keyboard's) prompts whatever was used last,
for screenshots.

For a first run on a 4 GB card such as a GTX 1650, `RX_VK_LOW_SPEC=1` starts with the Minimum (4GB) preset, with
frame generation and upscaling off. It applies only when there is no `hookshot_options.ini` yet; after that, change
the settings in the in-game menu.

`RX_VK_MOVIE_UPSCALE=linear` replaces the movies' neural upscale with the plain linear one. The default, `auto`, keeps
the networks and falls back only when a movie frame takes the GPU more than 40 ms. That is on NVIDIA cards: on other
cards, or where the GPU cannot multiply the networks' matrices itself, the movies always get the linear upscale. It does
not change the gameplay upscaler, and movies can look softer. `RX_VK_NETWORK_KEEP=all` takes precedence and keeps the
movie networks.

`RX_VK_SKIP_CODE=<prefix,...>` leaves out the draws of every program with a stage whose native code key starts with one
of the prefixes (the keys the log prints after "its code:"). On a Steam Deck, `RX_VK_SKIP_CODE=2c56dc1006942f74`
avoids a GPU hang in Kokiri Forest and the Great Deku Tree: the GPU runs for seconds in the programs that share that
task shader (a culling pass) until the kernel resets it ([#817](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/issues/817)).
It is a workaround, not a fix: those are task + mesh programs, so the geometry they draw goes with them, and key models
are missing while it is set. Off unless set.

The switches for scripted test runs, screenshots, frame dumps and profiles are in the
[development guide](docs/development.md#switches-for-testing-and-debugging).

</details>

## How it works

1. `nx2/lift.py` translates the game's ARM64 code to C.
2. `nx2/build.py` compiles that C together with `host/`, which plays the part of the console's system.
3. `host/nvn_native.c` records the game's NVN2 graphics calls, and `gpu/vk/` replays them on Vulkan.
4. Switch 2 Ampere shaders are lowered to Maxwell (`lower_to_maxwell.h`) and translated to SPIR-V by Eden's shader
   recompiler.

More detail is in the [development guide](docs/development.md) and the [design notes](docs/design.md).

## Want to help?

Testing on other graphics cards and reporting the result already helps a lot, and so does playing further into the
game than anyone has yet.

Bigger ways to help:

- **Linux testing.** The Linux build (`host/posix`) has been tested on several distributions and cards: reports from
  others still help.
- **Fixes in your own fork.** Fork the project, fix what you find and send the change back. Keep game files, keys and
  anything generated from your game out of it.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the setup, the test commands, the code conventions and what a good pull request
looks like.
