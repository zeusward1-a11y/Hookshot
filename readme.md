Hookshot is a static recompilation. The game's code is translated to C and compiled into a Windows program, the
console's system software is reimplemented, and the Switch 2 graphics are rebuilt on Vulkan. All of this happens
**on your PC, from your own copy of the game**.

## Project status

Experimental. It has only been tested on **one PC** (Ryzen 5 7600X, RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB), mostly in the area at the start
of the game.

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Kokiri Forest: reaching gameplay and walking around | ✅ Works |
| Sound, controller, keyboard and saves | ✅ Works |
| In-game menu, frame generation and upscaling | ✅ Works |
| Black flashes while moving | ✅ Fixed in testing, more play needed |
| Performance without frame generation | ⚠️ About 50 fps walking, not yet a steady 60 |
| Models with missing pieces (doors, fences, parts of trees) | ✅ Fixed where tested, more play needed |
| Stutter when entering new areas | ⚠️ Still happens, mostly the first time |
| Ultrawide | ⚠️ The 3D keeps its shape, but the HUD is stretched and the picture is softer |
| Hyrule Field and the rest of the game | ❓ Not tested yet |
| AMD and Intel cards | ❓ Never tested |

## How to build

The game does not come ready-made: it is built on your PC from your copy.

**With Hookshot Builder, the easiest:**

1. Download the HookshotBuilder zip from the Releases page, extract it, and run `HookshotBuilder.exe`. Keep the `tools`
   folder beside it.
2. Choose your game's `.nup`, or your `romfs` and `exefs` folders. The builder checks that it is the right version.
3. Choose a language and a folder for the finished game, and start the build.
4. When it finishes, open `hookshot.exe` in that folder.

**From the command line:**

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --nup "C:\path\your-game.nup" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Add `--log "C:\path\build.log"` to save the build output and errors while still seeing them in the terminal.
The log is UTF-8, is flushed as output arrives, and replaces an existing file at that path. Choose an existing
parent folder; if the log cannot be opened, the build stops before it starts. The same option works on Linux,
and with `--check` or `--update`.

Or with folders:

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --romfs "C:\path\romfs" --exefs "C:\path\exefs" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Add `--check` with your `.nup` or `--exefs` to only check the game's version. It builds nothing.

A build takes about 40 minutes, and you can use your PC in the meantime.

### On Linux

1. Download `Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` from the Releases page (or the Linux AppImage workflow's artifact),
   make it executable (`chmod +x`) and start it. It is Hookshot Builder with everything it needs inside: the compiler,
   the libraries and the Vulkan renderer. Nothing else has to be installed.
2. Choose your `.nup` (or your `romfs` and `exefs` folders), a language and a folder for the game, and build.
3. When it finishes, press Play. The game is also added to your applications menu. `hookshot` in the folder is the
   launcher (Play, and Update when a newer release is out). The game itself is `bin/hookshot`. The same AppImage
   starts that game without the window: `./Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage --play`, or `--play ~/Games/Hookshot`
   for a different folder. A folder built from a source checkout has no launcher: `hookshot` there is the game.

From the command line: `./Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage --cli --nup ~/your-game.nup --out ~/Games/Hookshot`
(the same options as `make_game.py`).

You need a 64-bit x86 PC with glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora, Arch, SteamOS ...), a Vulkan 1.3
driver with mesh shaders (Mesa or NVIDIA), and the same memory and disk space as on Windows. The build's own files go
to `~/.cache/hookshot-builder`. Saves go in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hookshot` (`~/.local/share/hookshot`). A `user` folder
beside the game from an earlier build is moved there once.

To choose how many files compile at once, launch the builder from a terminal with, for example,
`HOOKSHOT_JOBS=2 ./Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` (replace the filename with the one you downloaded).
Or run `export HOOKSHOT_JOBS=2` and launch the AppImage from that same terminal. Use a positive whole number;
`0`, an empty value or leaving it unset keeps automatic selection. The Linux builder still uses `RX_JOBS` when set;
otherwise it chooses as on Windows: one compiler per CPU thread, as many as the free memory holds at 2 GB each (a file
whose compiler runs out of memory is compiled again alone). The `--cli` route also accepts `--jobs 2`.
These are build settings: `hookshot_env.txt` is read by the running game, not by the builder.
Switches to test (`RX_VK_NOOPT=1` and the others) go in `hookshot_env.txt` beside the game, one `NAME=VALUE` a line,
as on Windows. A test run can name another file with `HOS_ENV_FILE=<path>`; the game then reads that one
instead and leaves `hookshot_env.txt` alone.

`RX_VK_MOVIE_UPSCALE=linear` replaces the movie's neural upscale with the existing linear path. The default `auto` behavior
keeps the networks and falls back only when movie GPU time exceeds the existing 40 ms trigger. This switch does not change
the gameplay upscaler and can make movie images look softer. It works on Windows and Linux; `RX_VK_NETWORK_KEEP=all` takes
precedence and keeps the movie networks enabled.

For a first run on a 4 GB card such as a GTX 1650, put `RX_VK_LOW_SPEC=1` in `hookshot_env.txt` beside the game.
This opts into the existing Minimum (4 GB) budget and 50% dynamic-resolution tier, disables frame generation and
post-process upscaling, and leaves any existing `hookshot_options.ini` unchanged. Once the game has started, the
same settings can be adjusted in the Insert menu. The profile also avoids the Vulkan capture helper threads, which
reduces CPU contention on a six-core CPU; set `RX_VK_CAPTURE_THREADS=1` or `2` explicitly if a particular scene
benefits from parallel capture.

Building it yourself without the AppImage: `clang` and `lld` (LLVM 23 or newer reads the play profile; an older one
builds without it), Python 3 with `lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `unicorn` and `zstandard`, FFmpeg's development files
(with dav1d, for the movies) and SDL3 (SDL2 works too). Then `python -I nx2/make_game.py ...` as above, with
`RX_CPM` pointing at a folder with Vulkan-Headers, SPIRV-Headers and VulkanMemoryAllocator in CPM's layout
(`scripts/linux/deps.sh` makes one).
`scripts/linux/deps.sh` and `scripts/linux/appimage.sh` make the AppImage.

### Updating to a newer release

A new release is not a patch to your game folder: the game is built again from your copy, with the new code. Your
saves and settings are kept. What changed in each release is in [changelog.txt](changelog.txt).

1. Close the game.
2. To be safe, copy your saves somewhere first: the `user` folder beside `hookshot.exe` on Windows, or
   `~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux.
3. Get the new release:
   - **Windows:** open `hookshot.exe` in the game folder and press Update, or run `HookshotBuilder.exe`. Only the
     parts of the builder that changed are downloaded, and only the game files that changed are compiled.
   - **Linux:** open `hookshot` in the game folder (or the AppImage) and press Update. The same: parts whose checksum
     did not change are kept, and the game is compiled again only where its code changed. The first AppImage is still
     the whole builder. A release from before this list was published downloads the parts once.
   - **Command line:** `git pull` in your clone, and take the `tools` folder's contents (see
     [What you need](#what-you-need)) from the new HookshotBuilder zip, as they can change between releases.
4. Update builds again into **the same game folder**. With the same game files, they are not read again. A part of the
   builder that did not change is not downloaded, and a compiled file whose source did not change is not compiled again.
5. Start the game as before.

What a new build keeps and what it replaces in the game folder:

| Kept | Replaced |
|---|---|
| Your saves (`user`, or `~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux) | `hookshot.exe` (`hookshot` on Linux) and its files |
| `hookshot_options.ini`, the in-game menu's choices | `image.bin` and the shader list |
| `hookshot_env.txt` | `language.txt`, written again with the language you choose |

### What you need

- Nothing to install for the build itself: Hookshot Builder brings its own compiler ([llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw),
  as TotK Recomp does), Python and libraries. Visual Studio and the Windows SDK are no longer needed.
- 64-bit Windows 10 or 11.
- A graphics card with Vulkan 1.3 and mesh shaders, with an up-to-date driver. Mesh shaders are required by the
  current renderer; older GPUs without them are not supported by a vertex/geometry fallback. Only NVIDIA has been tested.
- 16 GB of RAM or more. A run uses about 10 GB.
- About 60 GB free while building.
- **Your copy of the game at the supported version:** program `0400486024DEC000`, update v131072, build `e0f3ccfa`.
  Other versions do not work.

To build from the command line you also need:

- Python 3 with `lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `unicorn` and `zstandard`:
  `pip install lz4 numpy capstone "unicorn>=2.1,<2.2" zstandard`
  Use Python from python.org: the Microsoft Store's Python installs packages where `python -I` does not look.
- [llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) (the `ucrt-x86_64` build), with `HOOKSHOT_MINGW` set to its folder. Without
  it the build uses the clang from [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) at `C:\emsdk` with Visual Studio's C++ tools
  and the Windows SDK (`HOOKSHOT_MSVC=1` forces that route).
- Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 8, only if you want to change the builder itself.
- From Linux, the Windows game builds too: unpack llvm-mingw's Linux build (`ucrt-ubuntu-22.04-x86_64`), then run
  `make_game.py` with `RX_TARGET=windows` and `HOOKSHOT_MINGW` set to its folder. The objects go to
  `~/.cache/hookshot-builder-windows`, apart from the Linux game's. The game folder runs under Proton or on Windows.
- The prebuilt tools that go in `third_party/`: `a64emit`, `lld-link`, `zbic` and SDL2.
- What the HookshotBuilder zip carries in its `tools` folder and a clone does not. The builder sets the variables
  below itself; from the command line, set them before you run `make_game.py`:
  - `tools\cpm`: the Vulkan headers and FFmpeg. Set `RX_CPM` to this folder. Without it the build leaves out
    `hookshot_vk.dll`, the Vulkan renderer, and says nothing.
  - `tools\wgpu-native`: set `WGPU_NATIVE` to this folder.
  - `tools\third_party\sdl2\SDL2.dll`: copy it to `third_party\sdl2\`.
  - `tools\work`: copy it, with its `image` folder, to `work\`. It holds the hot-function list, the link order, the
    profile and the icon; without them the game builds but runs slower.

### What this does on your PC

- The build reads your game and never changes it. It writes to the folder you choose and to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder`.
- The romfs is hard-linked instead of copied where the disk allows it.
- To uninstall, delete the game folder and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder`.

### If something goes wrong

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| "Hookshot supports build e0f3ccfa" | Check that you chose the right game with its update installed |
| The game opens and closes | Update your graphics driver |
| Stutter the first time you see something | Normal for now: shaders are being prepared. It gets better when you pass through the same place again |
| The game is in the wrong language | Change the code in `language.txt` beside the game. The file lists them all |

If the problem continues, report it with where you were in the game, your graphics card and a screenshot or video.
Never send game files.

## In-game menu

Press <kbd>Insert</kbd> in game, or on a controller the Home button (or Select and Start together). Everything is off
by default, and your choices are saved in `hookshot_options.ini` beside the game. On a controller the D-pad chooses
and changes, the bottom face button changes too, and the right one closes the menu.

| Option | Choices |
|---|---|
| Quality preset | Custom, Minimum (4GB), Low (6GB), Balanced (8GB), High (12GB), Ultra (16GB+) |
| GPU device | Auto, or each graphics card by name (after a restart) |
| Frame generation | Off, 2x, 3x, 4x |
| Frame pacing | Off, On |
| Resolution | Auto (the game's own dynamic resolution), 100%, 75%, 67%, 50% |
| Upscaling | Off, Catmull-Rom, Lanczos |
| Sharpness | 0 to 100% |
| Game speed | Per frame, Real time |
| Handheld profile | Off, On |
| Ultrawide | 16:9, Monitor's shape |
| FPS counter | Off, On |

With Game speed on Per frame, the game runs slower whenever it is below 60 fps. Real time keeps it at normal speed.
Upscaling and Sharpness also work when Frame generation is Off.

GPU device matters on a PC with more than one graphics card (a laptop's integrated and dedicated GPUs, or a second
card for Lossless Scaling). Auto prefers a dedicated one, and only cards with Vulkan 1.3 are listed. `hookshot_log.txt`
lists every card as `vk: device <n>`; `RX_VK_DEVICE=<n>` chooses one for a single run and wins over the menu.

### Controls

Use a controller, or the keyboard and mouse. On the keyboard, <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> move
and the arrow keys turn the camera.

To change which gamepad button or key presses a Switch button, open the in-game menu's Controls page. Choose a
button and a column, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or the bottom face button), then the new button or key; <kbd>Delete</kbd>
clears it, and Reset to defaults puts them all back. A gamepad button taken from another Switch button swaps with it.
The page saves them in `hookshot_options.ini`, where you can also write them yourself:

```ini
pad_a=0
key_a=69,13
```

`pad_<button>` is a gamepad input by position: 0 bottom face button, 1 right, 2 left, 3 top, 4 Select or Back, 5 Home,
6 Start, 7 and 8 the stick presses, 9 and 10 the shoulder buttons, 11 to 14 the D-pad (up, down, left, right), 15 and
16 the triggers, -1 none. `key_<button>` is one or two
[Windows key codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) in decimal (69 is
<kbd>E</kbd>, 13 <kbd>Enter</kbd>), 0 none; the mouse's buttons are 1 (left), 2 (right), 4 (middle), 5 and 6 (side
buttons), and count while the mouse is captured. The buttons are `a` `b` `x` `y` `l` `r` `zl` `zr` `plus` `minus` `ls`
`rs` `left` `up` `right` `down`, and for keys only the left stick's and the camera's directions: `move_up`
`move_down` `move_left` `move_right` `cam_up` `cam_down` `cam_left` `cam_right`. A button the file leaves out keeps
its default.

## Mods

Put mods in a `mods` folder beside `hookshot.exe` (or point `HOS_MODS` at another folder), in the layout emulators
use: `mods/<name>/romfs/...` holds files that replace or add to the game's own. Deeper layouts such as
`mods/contents/<title id>/<name>/romfs` work too. A folder whose name starts with `-` or `_` is off. When two mods
have the same file, the one whose folder name sorts last wins, so name them `01-...`, `02-...` to set the order.

Only RomFS mods are loaded. `exefs` patches (`.pchtxt`, `.ips`) are left out: Hookshot compiles the game's code ahead
of time, so patching its instructions would need a rebuild. The log (`hookshot_log.txt` when started from its icon)
names each mod and the files read from it.

## How it works

1. `nx2/lift.py` translates the game's ARM64 code to C.
2. `nx2/build.py` compiles that C together with `host/`, which plays the part of the console's system.
3. `host/nvn_native.c` records the game's NVN2 graphics calls, and `gpu/vk/` replays them on Vulkan.
4. Switch 2 Ampere shaders are lowered to Maxwell (`lower_to_maxwell.h`) and translated to SPIR-V by Eden's shader
   recompiler.

More detail is in the [development guide](docs/development.md) and the [design notes](docs/design.md).

## Want to help?

Testing on other graphics cards and reporting the result already helps a lot, and so does playing further into the
game than anyone has yet.

Bigger ways to help:

- **Linux testing.** The Linux build (`host/posix`) has been tested on one PC so far: reports from other distributions
  and graphics cards help.
- **Fixes in your own fork.** Fork the project, fix what you find and send the change back. Keep game files, keys and
  anything generated from your game out of it.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the setup, the test commands, the code conventions and what a good pull request
looks like.
