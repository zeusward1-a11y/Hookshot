"""Stable chunk boundaries for the lifted C (lift.py --write).

a64-kit's write() closes a chunk once it reaches CHUNK_BYTES of text, so a function that grows (a jump table found,
a fix in one form) moves every boundary after it, and build.py recompiles every chunk from there on: a fix to two
functions cost a full 45-minute rebuild. Here the boundaries are guest addresses, kept in work/image/chunks.txt:
a chunk ends after the last function below the next boundary, so only the chunks holding changed functions differ.
Without the file (or with --rechunk) the boundaries come from the sizes, as before, and are saved.

write()'s test is `size >= chunk_bytes`. chunk_bytes is a Boundaries instance: an int whose reflected comparison
(__le__, which Python tries first for a subclass on the right) decides from the function just emitted.

The functions' C is made by several processes (fork, so Linux and macOS; one process elsewhere): each emits a run of
consecutive functions from the lifter as it stands, and write() takes the texts in its own order, as if it had made
them. The lifter's counters (stats, unhandled, ijump, and any passed in `counters`, such as poll.stats) get each
process's additions. The output is the one-process output, byte for byte (tests/test_parallel_emit.py).
